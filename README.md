Restaurant Management System using R shiny

By using this customers can order their food and their location where the food is to be delivered and the customer's review based on the food and delivery.

Here the food orders, reviews, locations are stored in seperate tables and each new entry in the UI for the respective table is added in the database.

Based on the food orders the income of the restaurant is predicted by using the time series analysis inorder to know about the restaurant's behaviour or restaurant's state over the time period.

The income is predicted for any day by using the concept of fitting trend.

In this analysis the income is predicted based on the exponential trend and by using the exponential trend the income is predicted for any day.

This project is helpful for the people who runs the restaurant inorder to predict their income by applying the concepts used here. And it is also useful for the food ordering system.
